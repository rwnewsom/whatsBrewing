## How to set up the database

In the dotnet database folder, you'll find the database creation script `capstone.sql`. Open this in SQL Server Management Studio and execute it.

## API Debugging Tips

- Test your server frequently in Postman
- Try to figure out if your server is getting a valid request (via debugging) and if the server is sending back a valid response (via debugging or Postman)
- Whenever possible, try to eliminate places where the error could be hiding and narrow it down to a specific class or method
- Refer to the debugging flowchart below for additional tips



## Code Review Criteria

- Your code should follow REST conventions wherever possible
- Your API should be secured against unauthenticated attackers
- Your API should forbid unauthenticated users from editing or leaving reviews
- You should not put all of your new controller methods inside of the Login Controller
- You should not put all of your client-side API code inside of the Auth Service
- Try to follow SOLID principles, keep methods small, and keep classes focused on a single responsibility principle
